# Web-development-bootcamp-projects

<h2> About This Repository </h2>

<p>This repository contains my work for the twelve-week AMSxOpenClassrooms web development skills bootcamp. This consisted firstly of video lectures and tutorials on the OpenClassrooms platform, followed by three practical assessed web development projects. This repository consists of my course files and notes for this bootcamp.</p>  

<p> <strong>Riding Cities (https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-1.netlify.app): </strong>The first project in this bootcamp was Riding Cities, which tasked students with adding elements to an existing webpage in HTML for a skateboarding company. This was achieved by first completing courses and live sessions to develop HTML skills and secondly by garnering an understanding of its project brief. This was assessed through a thirty-minute presentation on the OpenClassrooms platform.</p>  



<h2> Project 1 - Riding Cities  </h2>
<h3>1i Riding Cities Course Notes</h3>
<p>Riding Cities is the first web development project I completed during this bootcamp and was produced to develop HTML skills. This first consisted of two courses on the OpenClassrooms platform, my notes from these are included in the folder called '1i Riding Cities Course Notes by Fran_Panteli.zip.' More information about them is included below. </p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Set Up Your Front-End Development Environment</strong> - this was a 4 hour long course on configuring and using an IDE (VS Code) and was taught by Will Alexander and Mila Paul</li> 
  <li><strong>Build Your First Web Pages With HTML and CSS</strong> - this was a 10 hour long course and was produced by Emily Reese. This covered HTML and CSS</li>
  </ul> 
<h3>1ii Riding Cities Website</h3>
<p> Riding Cities is the first project which was produced as part of this bootcamp, to apply these skills. I was provided project files and a brief for this (although I have only included my final project files in this repository). For this, I was provided files for the current version of a website for a skateboarding company (Riding Cities) and a Figma mockup of items to be added to this page. I used HTML in VS Code to create the Founding Members and Footer sections for the project and deployed the project using Netlify, at (https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-1.netlify.app). </p>
<h3>1iii Riding Cities Public Speaking Skills Assessment</h3>
<p> This project was examined in a 30 minute oral presentation I gave on the OpenClassrooms platform, to develop public speaking and presentation skills. My flashcards from this assessment are available in the repository called '1iii Riding Cities Assessment.' </p>
