# Web-development-bootcamp-projects

<h2> About this repository </h2>

<p>This repository contains my work for the twelve-week AMSxOpenClassrooms web development skills bootcamp. This consisted firstly of video lectures and tutorials on the OpenClassrooms platform, followed by three practical assessed web development projects. This repository consists of my course files and notes for this bootcamp.</p>  

<p> <strong>Riding Cities (https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-1.netlify.app): </strong> the first project in this bootcamp was Riding Cities, which tasked students with adding elements to an existing webpage in HTML for a skateboarding company. This was achieved by first completing courses and live sessions to develop HTML skills and secondly through garnering an understanding of its project brief. This was assessed through a thiry minite presentation on the OpenClassrooms platform. </p>  

<p><strong>Booki (https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-2.netlify.app): </strong> the second project in this web development bootcamp was for a travel agency called Booki. This was an intensive six-week project designed to develop the HTML and CSS skills of students. This provided students with the mockup of the Booki travel agency company in Figma and tasked them with to converting it into a webpage. This was with a series of courses on the OpenClassrooms platform, mentoring sessions and live skills webinars at their disposal. This was similarly assessed in a thirty presentation on the OpenClassrooms platform.</p>

<p><strong>OhMyFood: </strong> the third project this bootcamp entailed was OhMyFood, which was a sex-week project with the aim of developing and spplying skills in SaaS, GitHub and applying animations to webpages.</p>

<h2> Project 1 - Riding Cities </h2>
<h3>1i Riding Cities Course Notes</h3>
<p>Riding Cities is the first web development project I completed during this bootcamp and was produced to develop HTML skills.  This first consisted of two courses on the OpenClassrooms platform, my notes from these are included in the folder called '1i Riding Cities Course Notes by Fran_Panteli.zip.' More information about them is included below. </p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Set Up Your Front-End Development Environment</strong> - this was a 4 hour long course on configuring and using an IDE (VS Code) and was taught by Will Alexander and Mila Paul</li> 
  <li><strong>Build Your First Web Pages With HTML and CSS</strong> - this was a 10 hour long course and was produced by Emily Reese. This covered HTML and CSS</li>
  </ul> 
<h3>1ii Riding Cities Website</h3>
<p> Riding Cities is the first project which was produced as part of this bootcamp, to apply these skills. I was provided project files and a brief for this (although I have only included my final project files in this repository). For this, I was provided files for the current version of a website for a skateboarding company (Riding Cities) and a Figma mockup of items to be added to this page. I used HTML in VS Code to create the Founding Members and Footer sections for the project and deployed the project using Netlify, at (https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-1.netlify.app). </p>
<h3>1iii Riding Cities Public Speaking Skills Assessment</h3>
<p> This project was examined in a 30 minute oral presentation I gave on the OpenClassrooms platform, to develop public speaking and presentation skills. My flashcards from this assessment are available in the repository called '1iii Riding Cities Assessment.' </p>
<h2> Project 2 - Booki </h2>
<h3> 2i Booki Course Notes </h3>
<p> Booki is the second web development project I completed during this bootcamp and was produced to develop HTML and CSS skills. The aim of this was to develop these skills by completing course material and apply this knowledge by converting the mockup of a travel agancy called Booki into a webpage. This mockup was provided in Figma. </p>

<p>The first stage associated with this was the completion of three further courses on the OpenClassrooms platform. My notes from these have been included in the project files for Booki (in the folder '2i Booki Course Notes by Fran_Panteli'), further information about them is detailed below.</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Design a Mock-up for Web Development With Figma </strong>- the first course was a 6 hour long course on wireframes and mockups in Figma and which was taught by Alexia Toulmet and Mike Miello</li>
  <li><strong>Create Web Page Layouts With CSS</strong> - the second was a 10 hour long course which included Flexbox, 2D layouts with the CSS grid, CSS positioning techniques and legacy layouts. This was produced by Emily Reese </li>
  <li><strong>Break Down and Integrate a Mockup</strong> - the latter was a 6 hour long course covering breaking down and integrating a mockup and was also produced by Emily Reese</li>
  </ul> 

<h3> 2ii Booki Website</h3>
<h4>
Problem Solving Thought Proccess
</h4>
<p>The second stage following completion of these courses was converting the Booki mockup in Figma into a webpage using HTML and CSS in VSCode. The approach I found that worked for this was to use the problem solving thought process I had garnered from my studies in Physics. This approach to problem solving was:
<ol>
	<li>Write down what you want</li>
		<li>Write down what you know</li>
		<li>Write down the different ways of getting there</li>
		<li>Pick the one which would be the most likely to work</li>
		<li>Execute the route which you think would be the most likely to work as carefully as possible</li> 
		<li>If it fails then write down your learnings and try the next best approach, if not then analyse the results to see if they match the mockup</li> 
</ol>

<p>The approach I found which worked for this project was to treat each section of the mockup as its own problem to be solved. I systematised this approach by annotating the index.html file for this project with these problem solving thought processes. These thought proccesses may be found in the project files in this repository called '2ii Booki Website by Fran_Panteli.zip' and the deployed project may be found at the netlify links below.</p>
<h4>Webpage Links</h4>
<ul>
	<li>https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-2.netlify.app - this is the link to the webpage I created using VSCode called Booki </li>
	<li>https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-2-sandbox.netlify.app - this is a link to my html sandbox for this project. This contains additional work I did to add links around the cards in the centre of the section on the webpage, as an extension to the project. The HTML for this is found in the sandbox file in folder 2ii </li>
</ul>

<h4>Media Queries</h4>
<p>Media queries were used to enable the page to operate for desktops and large desktop versions as per the project breif. There is a void region below the desktop breakpoint where the background of the page turns green, to indicate that the mobile breakpoint region has been entered (below which the behaviour of the webpage is nullified). It was found that defining elements of the webpage in percentages enabled this page resizing. </p>

<h4>A Refined Approach to the Problem Solving Thought Proccess for Booki</h4>

<p>One point to note from this project was the importance of idenfitying the exact requirements of the project before it was undertaken. In the first stage of the problem solving thought proccess ('write down what you want'), it was found that the requirements of the Booki webpage existed in two main forms. The first, being the functionality of the webpage and the second being its styling and precise dimensions.  While the prior was provided from the project breif, the latter was provided by its mockup in Figma. </p>

<p>This shows the importance of using the two in tandem during stage 1 of the problem solving thought proccess. In order to garner a full view of what the project requirements are, its functionality and dimensions must first be understood (rather than soely its dimensions). Understanding the exact requirements of the Booki webpage was one of the most important stages of this poject, as if certain elements were omitted by error, more chaos would ensue closer to the project deadline in order to recify the issue. </p>

<p>It was also noted during the project that 'what you want' may change. In this case,  changes were made to the mockup for the project in Figma half way through the project completion. It was found that the approach which worked to manage this challenge was the use of an HTML sandbox. In this case, this was a separate HTML file which linked to the same CSS document as the main index.html file. This sandbox isolated atoms on the page, which meant that when changes were made to core atoms on the webpage in its mockup, they would already be isolated in the sandbox for editing.</p>
