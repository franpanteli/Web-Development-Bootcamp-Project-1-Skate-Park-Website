# Web-development-bootcamp-projects

<h2> About this repository </h2>

<p>This repository contains my work for the twelve-week AMSxOpenClassrooms web development skills bootcamp. This consisted firstly of video lectures and tutorials on the OpenClassrooms platform, followed by three practical assessed projects in web development. This consists of an introductory HTML project, followed by two more in-depth six-week projects. This repository consists of my course files and notes for this bootcamp.</p>  

<h2> Project 1 - Riding Cities </h2>

<p> Riding Cities is the first web development project I completed during this bootcamp and was produced to develop HTML skills. </p>

<h3>1i Riding Cities Course Notes</h3>

This first consisted of two courses on the OpenClassrooms platform:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set Up Your Front-End Development Environment</li> 
    <li>Build Your First Web Pages With HTML and CSS</li>

  </ul> 
<p>The prior was a 4 hour long course on configuring and using an IDE (VS Code) and was taught by Will Alexander and Mila Paul. The latter was a 10 hour long course and was produced by Emily Reese. This covered HTML and CSS. My notes from these are included in the project files for Riding Cities.</p>

<h3>1ii Riding Cities Website:</h3>
<p> Riding Cities is the first project which was produced as part of this bootcamp, to apply these skills. I was provided project files and a brief for this (although I have only included my final project files in this repository). For this, I was provided files for the current version of a website for a skateboarding company (Riding Cities) and a Figma mockup of items to be added to this page. I used HTML in VS Code to create the Founding Members and Footer sections for the project and deployed the project using Netlify, at (https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-1.netlify.app). </p>

<p><em>1iii Riding Cities Assessment:</em></p>

<p> This project was examined in a 30 minute oral presentation I gave on the OpenClassrooms platform, to develop oral and presentation skills. My flashcards from this assessment are available in the repository called '1iii Riding Cities Assessment.' </p>

<h2> Project 2 - Booki </h2>

<p> Booki is the second web development project I completed during this bootcamp and was produced to develop HTML and CSS skills. This consisted of three further courses on the OpenClassrooms platform:</p>

<h3> 2i: Booki Course Notes <h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design a Mock-up for Web Development With Figma</li>
    <li>Create Web Page Layouts With CSS</li>
    <li>Break Down and Integrate a Mockup</li>
  </ul> 
<p> The first was a 6 hour long course on wireframes and mockups in Figma, which was taught by Alexia Toulmet and Mike Miello. The second was a 10 hour long course which included Flexbox, 2D layouts with the CSS grid, CSS positioning techniques and legacy layouts. This course was produced by Emily Reese. The latter was a 6 hour long course covering breaking down and integrating a mockup and was also produced by Emily Reese. My notes from these are included in the project files for Booki.
